## Authentication System and Frontend Implementation - 2024-03-14 15:30 UTC (v1.2.0)

### Added Authentication System
#### User Management
- Created User model with secure password hashing
- Implemented role-based access (admin/user)
- Added user management CLI tool for administrators
- Added secure password comparison methods
- Implemented email uniqueness constraints

#### Authentication Routes
- Added secure login/logout functionality
- Implemented JWT token-based authentication
- Added cookie-based session management
- Protected API routes with auth middleware
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

#### Frontend Views
- Created responsive login interface
- Implemented protected dashboard view
- Added navigation with conditional rendering based on auth state
- Removed public registration (admin-only user creation)
- Added proper error message display

### Security Implementations
- **Cookie Security**: 
  - HTTP-only cookies for JWT storage
  - Secure cookie flag for production
  - 24-hour token expiration
- **Password Security**:
  - bcrypt hashing for passwords
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Secure password comparison
- **Route Protection**:
  - Authentication middleware for API routes
  - Protected dashboard access
  - Secure logout handling

### Technical Improvements
- **Dependencies**: Added required security packages
  - cookie-parser for cookie handling
  - bcryptjs for password hashing
  - jsonwebtoken for JWT implementation
  - express-validator for input validation
- **Database**: Enhanced MongoDB connection
  - Added better error handling
  - Improved connection stability
  - Added IPv4 forcing for better compatibility
- **Error Handling**:
  - Added proper error messages
  - Implemented user-friendly error displays
  - Added development vs production error handling

### Breaking Changes
- Removed public registration functionality
- Changed authentication to cookie-based system
- Modified database connection configuration
- Updated route structure for API endpoints

### Notes
- User creation now requires admin access through CLI
- Authentication uses secure HTTP-only cookies
- Database errors won't crash the application
- Login redirects to dashboard on success

### Future Considerations
- Add password reset functionality
- Implement email verification
- Add session management system
- Implement rate limiting
- Add audit logging for user actions
