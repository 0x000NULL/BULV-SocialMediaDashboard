- Added log rotation event tracking
- Enhanced MongoDB error detection
- Added proper error inheritance chain

### Breaking Changes
- Changed error response format for API endpoints
- Modified error handling middleware chain
- Updated error page routing
- Changed logging output format and structure

### Notes
- Log files are now automatically rotated and compressed
- Error pages maintain consistent branding
- API errors include stack traces in development
- Security events are properly tracked and logged

### Future Considerations
- Add log aggregation system
- Implement log analysis tools
- Add error reporting service integration
- Add real-time error notifications
- Implement error rate monitoring 

## Authentication System and Frontend Implementation - 2024-03-14 15:30 UTC (v1.2.0)

### Added Authentication System
#### User Management
- Created User model with secure password hashing
- Implemented role-based access (admin/user)

- Removed public registration (admin-only user creation)
- Added proper error message display

### Security Implementations
- **Cookie Security**: 
  - HTTP-only cookies for JWT storage
  - Secure cookie flag for production
  - 24-hour token expiration
- **Password Security**:
  - bcrypt hashing for passwords
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Secure password comparison
- **Route Protection**:
  - Authentication middleware for API routes
  - Protected dashboard access
  - Secure logout handling

### Technical Improvements
- **Dependencies**: Added required security packages
  - cookie-parser for cookie handling
  - bcryptjs for password hashing

### Breaking Changes
- Removed public registration functionality
- Changed authentication to cookie-based system
- Modified database connection configuration
- Updated route structure for API endpoints

### Notes
- User creation now requires admin access through CLI
- Authentication uses secure HTTP-only cookies
- Database errors won't crash the application
- Login redirects to dashboard on success

### Future Considerations
- Add password reset functionality
- Implement email verification
- Add session management system
- Implement rate limiting
- Add audit logging for user actions
